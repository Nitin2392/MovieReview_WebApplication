# MovieReview_WebApplication
An interactive movie review website which allows users to provide reviews to movies of their choice along
with viewing existing reviews and ratings for that movie aggregated from different websites like IMDB, Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes

## WEBSITE FEATURES : 

* Type in a name of the movie that you wish to review
* Once you type in the movie of your choice, you will receive a thorough information about the movie.
* There will be a consolidated view showing reviews/ratings about the movie from IMDB, Metacritic and RottenTomatoes.
* This is achieved by calling the following API (Feel free to change the name of the movie in the q parameter)
[API link](https://api.nytimes.com/svc/movies/v2/reviews/search.json?api-key=e992a0ab848147aea7e2cb85d44ea3df&query=Interstellar)

* The application then allows you to provide your own review and you also have the option to Edit, Delete the review and provide a movie category for the same
* The application also shows all the existing reviews for all movies.

## FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS 

* The future scope of this application is to develop this application into a ticket booking application
* Movie watchers are influenced by reviews. Given the need to spend money to watch a movie, they believe in getting the best bet for the bucks they are paying.
* Keeping that in mind, the goal of this movie ticketing application would be to allow users to enter the name of the movie they want to watch, extract existing reviews/rating from the top review websites - **all at one place** and then allow the user to book tickets for the same using the application.
* The user can get back to the website and add their own review for the movie thus encouraging crowd sourcing
